== MoxieForum Standalone Overview

This is a Rails 3 app with moxie_forum and authlogic installed. MoxieForum is a full-featured forum engine for Rails 3, it's packaged as a gem. You can find this gem at http://github.com/krschacht/moxieforum 

Since this forum is a rails engine, it's not designed to run stand-alone. Instead, it's designed to integrate with your existing user application--to piggyback on your existing user model and user authentication.

However, if you are looking for stand-alone forum software complete with registration, you've found it. That's what this moxieforum_standalone is. It's a Rails v3 app that uses authlogic for user authentication and has moxie_forum plugged in already.
